# 🌐 Network Cables — Overview

Cables are the **physical medium** used to transmit data between devices in a network.  
Different cables vary in **speed, distance, and usage**.

## 🧵 1. Twisted Pair Cables

### 🔹 UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)
- Most common cable for LANs.  
- Contains **4 pairs of color-coded wires twisted together** to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI).  
- Categories:

| Category | Max Speed | Max Distance | Usage |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Cat5 | 100 Mbps | 100 m | Older LANs |
| Cat5e | 1 Gbps | 100 m | Common LANs today |
| Cat6 | 10 Gbps | 55 m | High-speed networks |
| Cat6a | 10 Gbps | 100 m | Future-proof high-performance LANs |
| Cat7 | 10 Gbps+ | 100 m | Special applications, better shielding |

### 🔹 STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)
- Same as UTP but with **metal shielding** around pairs to reduce interference.  
- Used in **high EMI environments**.

## 🔌 2. Coaxial Cable

- A **central copper conductor** surrounded by an insulator and metallic shield.  
- Resistant to interference compared to twisted pair.  
- Used in older **TV networks and LANs**.  
- Lower speed and distance limitations compared to UTP/STP.

## ⚡ 3. Fiber Optic Cables

- Transmits data using **light through glass or plastic fibers**.  
- Advantages:
  - Very high speed (10 Gbps+).  
  - Long-distance transmission without signal loss.  
  - Immune to electromagnetic interference.  
- Types:
  - **Single-mode Fiber (SMF)**: long-distance, narrow beam.  
  - **Multi-mode Fiber (MMF)**: shorter distance, wider beam, lower cost.

## 🔗 4. Cable Connectors

- **RJ-45** → UTP/STP cables.  
- **BNC** → Coaxial cables.  
- **LC / SC / ST** → Fiber optic cables.

| Cable Type | Speed | Max Distance | Use Case |
|------------|-------|--------------|----------|
| UTP Cat5e | 1 Gbps | 100 m | Common LANs |
| UTP Cat6 | 10 Gbps | 55 m | High-speed LANs |
| STP | Same as UTP | Same | High EMI environments |
| Coaxial | 10-100 Mbps | 500 m | Older LANs / TV networks |
| Fiber Optic SMF | 10 Gbps+ | 40+ km | Long-distance, high-speed |
| Fiber Optic MMF | 10 Gbps | 2 km | Shorter LAN backbones |
