# Network Basics

## 1. Network Definition

A **network** is a system of two or more devices connected together to share data and resources (such as files, internet, printers, servers). These devices communicate using rules called **protocols**.

**Purpose of Networking:**

* Communication (emails, messaging)
* Resource sharing (printers, storage)
* Data transfer and remote access
* Centralized management and security

## 2. Network Components

| Component             | Role                                                     | Example                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **End Devices**       | Devices that send/receive data                           | Computers, Phones, Printers  |
| **Switch**            | Connects devices inside the same LAN using MAC addresses | Office Switch                |
| **Router**            | Connects different networks using IP addresses           | Home Wi-Fi Router            |
| **Access Point (AP)** | Provides wireless connectivity                           | Wi-Fi Hotspot                |
| **Network Media**     | Physical / wireless connection paths                     | Ethernet Cable, Wi-Fi Signal |
| **Firewall**          | Protects the network by filtering traffic                | Hardware/Software Firewalls  |

## 3. Network Types

| Type                                | Coverage Area           | Example                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **PAN (Personal Area Network)**     | Few meters              | Bluetooth between phone & earbuds |
| **LAN (Local Area Network)**        | Single building or home | Home or Office Network            |
| **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** | City / Campus area      | University network                |
| **WAN (Wide Area Network)**         | Country / Worldwide     | The Internet                      |

**Most common:** **LAN** for local networks and **WAN** for the internet.

## 4. Network Topologies

Topology = The physical or logical layout of network devices.

| Topology   | Description                                 | Pros                     | Cons                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Bus**    | All devices share a single cable            | Cheap, simple            | One cable failure affects all   |
| **Star**   | All devices connect to a central switch     | Reliable, easy to manage | If switch fails → network stops |
| **Ring**   | Devices connect in a circular path          | Simple data flow         | Failure affects whole ring      |
| **Mesh**   | Every device connects to every other device | Highly reliable          | Very expensive & complex        |
| **Hybrid** | Mix of topologies                           | Flexible & scalable      | Complex to design               |

**Most used today:** **Star Topology** (due to switches in LANs).
